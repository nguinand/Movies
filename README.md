# Movies
The Movie Trailer Website project consists of server-side code to store a list of movies titles, along with its respective box art imagery and movie trailer website. The data should be served as a web page allowing visitors to review the movies and watch the trailers

To run this program. You must have python installed and configured on your terminal. 

There are 3 files in this small project.

1)pageGenerator.py: This page handles the HTML structure coupled with python functions for the logic of what goes into each div.

2)movie.py: Parent class. Holds the contructor for the movie object. Takes in a title, storyline, poster image, and youtube trailer link.

3)runMovie.py: I consider this the main class. This is where the objects are instantiated. There are currently 5 objects. They go into an array and are passed to pageGenerator.py

NOTE: Due to copyright or restrictions, some trailers may not play.
